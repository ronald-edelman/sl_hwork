I’ve swopped over recently from Java to C#.Net and have elected to use C# as my programming language.

However, the principles applied would remain the same across both languages.

Critique of the current code snippet:

- The snsClient is created in the constructor, it also has a variable Region setting. Should creation fail in the constructor the full creation will fail. It is recommended to extract this into a notification type object responsible for publishing the message - where this is dependency injected and the client created (in scope and possibly on demand)
- All the SQL withdrawal logic and the publishing of the message is implemented in the Post method - this violates single responsibility as the post should receive the payload and delegate functionality to a service or processor object.
- As this is a Rest controller it may be problematic for the parameters to be extracted from the RequestParam. RequestParam assumes the content type is url form encoded. To improve readability and extensibility a DTO type of object such as a WithdrawlRequest should encapsulate the body of the message. This encourages better use as an API type of controller, whilst improving readability.
- The SQL update does not lock the rows being affected by the accountId, this means other requests coming through could have invalid data either through a dirty read, phantom read or persisting an incorrect account balance of the same accountId. Row level locking or at least a Repeatable read (preferably Serializable) isolation level should be done to ensure correct isolation level, done within a transaction.
- There is a lack of exception management and graceful handling thereof.  This additionally manifests itself in the lack of correct Http response codes that are not returned to the caller. Without the correct responses codes, the caller has to interrogate the message string which is bad practice. Good Restful practice is to return the correct Http response code in the API call.
- A common practice to send back errors during execution is to throw an Exception of varying types e.g. an InsufficientFundsException or AccountNotFoundException. I have elected to follow a cleaner approach where a response object is returned that encapsulates the state of the execution. The caller can then gracefully handle the response e.g. send back an appropriate Http code or handle it differently as opposed to jumping out of the call stack.
- The WithdrawalEvent serializes its own internals as Json - it should rather be delegated to a proper Json serializer from a well-known library.
- The topicArn should not be hardcoded and rather injected from configuration into the Notification object that is responsible for the publishing.
- It is noted that the SQL itself can be subject to finger trouble. The statements are converted to PreparedStatements under the hook, but I would further caution against the possibility that this remains hardcoded.  The least, should be that the data mutation and read logic is abstracted behind a well-known Repository pattern - with suitable regression testing. This allows the SQL to be contained in the Repository object.
- In order to avoid further finger trouble - it is possible to use an OR/M that abstracts the SQL from the user and ensures a consistent, predictable output of statements. An OR/M may add additional overhead - it will need to be a debate of maintainability vs throughput and the risk presented by each.
- The modularisation of the code could be improved so that the functionality is moved into dedicated namespaces that more accurately indicate the type of logic that is in the folder
- The withdraw method returns but never gets a chance to publish the message
- As the  code is refactored, more opportunities present for further code and structure clean-up - for example introducing a class hierarchy for events.
- There is a lack of instrumentation and observability in the code, as well a lack of logging. At least logging should be included in the implementation. However the methods could be instrumented dynamically. Emitting metrics for improved observability is also encouraged.
- I do not see resilience built in to the service for example throttling, rate limiting and preventing the API from potential DDoS attack vectors. These protection mechanisms can be applied from outside and though recommended and noted, but not included in the submission.
- Robustness should be built in with appropriate retry strategies especially with calling the SnsClient publish.
- Opportunity to clean up the constructor of WithdrawalEvent so that the response message is deterministic - small nit but can be useful for predictability
- Though unit testing is not included in submission, the refactoring, separation of concerns and interface segregation improves testability and the ability to mock.
- There is opportunity to improve validation and guards against invalid data or data out of range.
- Additionally for auditing the calling information about the requestor should also be included in the payload, whether included as a param, extracted from the header or in the auth token.

I have elected to make most of these improvement above, in C#, and with the appropriate libraries to assist in achieving these goals. The same can be done in Java.

Note: I have elected to use the EntityFramework within C# t avoid SQL finger trouble + injection. However with pure native SQL the approach would be the same - lock appropriately on the rows (with a For update) or the accountId, ensure the IsolationLevel and conduct the execution in a transaction.
